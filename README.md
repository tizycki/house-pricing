# House pricing - regression and classification problem

### Quick overview
This project covers end-to-end models implementation with preprocessing and Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA).
Classification task was solved by predicting price_bin feature and regression was base on price feature.

Projects contains as well preprocessing pipelines, model prototyping while hyperparameter tuning was performed
using cross-validated Bayes search (skopt package).
